Some Plone UI functionality will not work with all plugins.
many plugins cannot modify users/properties/groups/etc. There is some
capabilities checking now, so that things that cannot be changed will not
appear changeable.

PlonePAS implements a good deal of the API expected of a UserFolder
and of GRUF. However, no systematic determination of interface
fulfillment has been made, beyond that used by the Plone UI. Over time
GRUF compatibility will be removed in favour of a new interface on top
of PAS.

PlonePAS will currently migrate the users and groups of a default
Plone setup. Other setups may work. Please see the README.

Using GRUF as a multi-source may work, but hasn't been looked at
recently.

PlonePAS will also migrate existing LDAPUserFolder+GRUF setups. It
will use the ADMultiPlugin by default: there's no LDAP/AD detection yet.

Please also see the README and NOTES.
