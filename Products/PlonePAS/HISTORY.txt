Changelog for PlonePAS

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

PlonePAS 3.9 - April 21, 2009

    - Fix the cookie plugin's login handler to not trust the username
      from the request. Instead we use the login name of the currently
      authenticated user. This fixes CVE-2009-0662 (see
      http://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/cve-2009-0662
      for more information).
      [wichert]

PlonePAS 3.8 - February 13, 2009

    - Update the role manager's assignRoleToPrincipal method to lazily
      update the cached list of portal roles. This fixes problems with
      adding users with GenericSetup-created roles.
      [wichert]

    - Fixed our OrderedDict to be unpickable with pickle protocol 2. On
      unpickling a __init__ method is not called and an optimization in
      protocol 2 would call __setitem__ without the _list to be initialized.
      Even using a __getstate__ / __setstate__ combination wouldn't work
      around that. This change was found in using membrane and
      MemcachedManager.
      [hannosch, tesdal]


PlonePAS 3.7 - September 28, 2008

    - Removed deprecation zcml statements for PluggableAuthService components:
      these are now in PluggableAuthService itself.
      [wichert]

    - Adjusted deprecation warnings to point to Plone 4.0 instead of Plone 3.5
      since we changed the version numbering again.
      [hannosch]

PlonePAS 3.6 - June 25, 2008

    - Modify PloneGroup.getMemberIds to use all IGroupIntrospection plugins
      to get the group members. This makes it possible to list members in
      an LDAP group.
      [wichert]

PlonePAS 3.5 - June 25, 2008

    - Make PASSearchView.merge actually merge search results. Its previous
      behaviour was quite nasty: it preferred search results from the
      enumeration plugin with the lowest priority!
      [wichert]


PlonePAS 3.4 - March 26, 2008

    - Ignore but log users without passwords during migration from pre-PAS, as
      these cannot be added to any standard user source.
      [hannosch]

    - Fix listRoleInfo on the role plugin to also lazily update the list
      of portal roles.
      [wichert]


PlonePAS 3.3 - March 7, 2008

    - Add metadata.xml to the GenericSetup profile.
      [wichert]

    - Move global role lookup out of the local role plugin. Part of the
      PLIP 127 merge for Plone 3.1.
      [alecm]

PlonePAS 3.2 - Febuary 15, 2008

    _ Fix schema handling for ZODBMutablePropertyProvider initialisation.
      [maurits]

    - Remove some exception swalling from the installation logic so errors
      are not hidden.
      [hannosch]

    - Correct handling an empty roles list when modifying groups.
      This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6994
      [rsantos]

PlonePAS 3.1 - October 8, 2007

    - Improve handing of sorting for searches.
      [csenger]

    - Updating the roles for a group did not invalidate the _findGroup cache.
      [wichert]

    - Fixed some tool icons to point to existing icons.
      [hannosch]

PlonePAS 3.0 - August 16, 2007

   - Fix check for authenticateCredentials return value
     [rossp]

PlonePAS 3.0rc2 - July 27, 2007

    - Fake a getPhysicalPath on our search view so ZCacheing works properly
      everywhere.
      [wichert]

    - Add event classes for logged-in and logged-out events.
      [wichert]

PlonePAS 3.0rc1 - July 8, 2007

    - Correct logic in MemberData capability methods: any plugin is
      allowed to (re)set a password, delete the user or add roles. 
      [wichert]

    - Use the proper API to get the containing PAS in the group plugin
      [wichert]

    - Fix setting user properties on the user object.
      [wichert]


PlonePAS 3.0b7 - May 5, 2007

    - Removed the five:registerPackage statement again. It causes problems in a
      ZEO environment.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed our version of the Plone tool from ToolInit. It won't get an icon
      anymore and you cannot add it, but existing instances still work. We
      migrate all instances back to the regular tool anyways.
      [hannosch]

PlonePAS 3.0b6 - May 5, 2007

    - Fixed two migration related test failures.
      [hannosch]

    - Spring cleaning, removed some cruft, pyflaked and corrected some more
      undefined names.
      [hannosch]

    - New package layout, following standard Python package conventions.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed tool names in ToolInit, so the permission has a proper name. This
      closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6525.
      [hannosch]

PlonePAS 3.0-beta5 - May 2, 2007

    - Modify the roles plugin to lazily update its roles list from the portal.
      [wichert]

    - Filter duplicate search results.
      [laz, wichert]

    - Add a sort_by option to the search methods to allow sorting of results
      by a property. 
      [laz, wichert]

    - Modify login method for the cookie plugin to perform the credential
      update in the PAS of the user instead of the PAS of the plugin. This
      helps in making sure that users will only authenticate against their
      own user folder, so we get all their roles, properties, etc. correctly.
      [wichert]

    - Update installation logic to use plone.session for cookies
      [wichert]

    - Add pas_info and pas_search browser views.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
      standard Plone version.
      [wichert]

    - Use getUtility to get the portal object.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
      in favour of PAS enumeration.
      [wichert]

    - Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
      searches.
      [wichert]

    - Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
      [wichert]

    - Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
      group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
      possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
      virtual group can be used instead.
      [wichert]

    - Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub 
      for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
      export and import! At the moment it do not export the 
      propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two 
      additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
      hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.      
      [jensens]
      
    - Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
      [hannosch]


PlonePAS 2.4 - April 15, 2007

    - Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
      local_roles is empty
      [dreamcatcher]

    - the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
      and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
      the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
      propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
      [k_vertigo]

    - More postonly security changes
      [alecm, ramon]


PlonePAS 2.3 - May 30, 2007

    - Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone 
      2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
      [wichert]

    - Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
      [mj]

    - Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
      as GRUF itself uses.
      [mj]

    - Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
      types.
      [reinout]

    - Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
      [dreamcatcher]

    - Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
      migration.
      [tesdal]

    - Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
      for the exact id, not substrings.
      [tesdal]
      
    - Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
      plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.
      [wichert]
